Hi, welcome to the OpenMV Cam tutorial. I'm Kwabena, co-founder of OpenMV. I'll
be your guide for how to use your OpenMV Cam. In this guide I'll tell you how
to use your OpenMV Cam effectively.

What makes the OpenMV Cam so powerful is the combination of MicroPython and
Machine Vision in an easy to use low-power package. Never before have you
been able to run high powered computer vision algorithms while combined
with I/O pin control like you'd find on an Arduino while still being able
to run off of a USB port.

MicroPython makes working with complex data structures on microcontrollers easy
and its power is what makes more advanced computer vision algorithms like
Face Detection and Multiblob color tracking easy to use. With MicroPython,
functions can return dynamically sized lists of objects and you don't have
to worry about pointers or memory management like you would have with C. This
makes the OpenMV Cam a great tool for beginners and professionals alike who are
either new computer vision and microcontroller programming or who just need
to be able to develop an application that works without issues quickly.
