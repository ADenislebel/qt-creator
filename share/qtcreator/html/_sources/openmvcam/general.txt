General information about the openmv cam
========================================

Local filesystem and SD card
----------------------------

If you don't have an SD card installed then your OpenMV Cam will have its file
system root directory set to the internal flash. If an SD card is installed
instead then the root directory will be set to that. When the SD card is inserted
the internal filesystem is not accessible.

.. note:: File system support will be re-worked in the future to work like all
          other pyboards. File system support works like this right now because
          the base OpenMV code is rather old and we never got around to fixing
          this issue.

Boot modes
----------

Connect the BOOT0 pin to 3.3V/RST before plugging the OpenMV Cam into your
computer to put your OpenMV Cam into DFU mode. In DFU mode you can use DFU
programmer tools to un-brick your OpenMV Cam if you were editing the firmware
yourself for a custom experience.

Errors: flashing LEDs
---------------------

If you see the red LED flashing (and you didn't program it to do so) then your
OpenMV Cam encountered an unrecoverable hardware error.

If you see the red LED turn on randomly but not flash then that is just your
computer accessing the OpenMV Cam's flash file system.
